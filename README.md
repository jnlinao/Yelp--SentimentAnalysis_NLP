# Hi James, 
To provide an update to the hardware situation at TEM, Rudy had just sent a couple of Keyence BT-A700GA Scanners which had just arrived today. To supplement the configuration and support of getting these guys set at various plants including TEM, I am attaching an SOP for your reference. We had originally supported the successful pilot with these scanners with Ricky at PHI. The documentation covers installation and set-up of the scanner OOB with the appropriate software +  user/admin navigation. 

Also attached are the Velocity Console files required for Scanner software set up. Details are discussed in the SOP. 

Please feel free to reach out for any questions or concerns.
