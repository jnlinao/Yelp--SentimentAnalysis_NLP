### Use Case: Utilizing consumer reviews to develop data-driven insights for restaurants on how to improve their business during Covid-19

## Business Problem :thought_balloon:
Covid-19 challenged many people on a global scale, especially businesses and their operations. Business owners who have significantly struggled are restuarant owners. The new landscape has pushed restaurants to make changes to their businesses such as the new emphasis on takeout orders. Because it is vital to be adaptable, restaurants must understand new novel internal trends within their business in order to survive. 

Consumers discuss their experiences and opinions through their Yelp reviews, making it a valuable resource for identifying areas of strengths as well as critical pain points. **Ultimately, sentiment analysis through NLP modeling can help understand consumers as a whole by detecting businessâ€™ day-to-day successes and faults, and remedying them over time.**
